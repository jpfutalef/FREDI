# FREDI

An amusing and innovative helper for rehabilitation.

## What's FREDI?

FREDI is the acronym for Forestating and Rehabilitation via Entertainment, Diversity and Innovation.

Its design and technology is intended to be used by people who have movement disabilities and be a help to kinesiologists.

## Why forestating?

FREDI was designed as a prototype for "Fundaci√≥n Esperanza Nuestra", a non-lucrative chilean foundation for rehabilitation. One of the functionalities included to motivate users to use FREDI is the ability to water part of the landscape once the exercise is completed, being able to recover dry areas and maintain the green without human intervention.
